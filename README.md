## What Makes This Different

**Foundation-First Approach**: Unlike typical LeetCode repositories, this starts with programming fundamentals - because great algorithms need great code structure.

**Why Over What**: Every implementation includes:
- **Problem Analysis**: Breaking down requirements
- **Approach Comparison**: When to use recursion vs iteration, different data structure choices
- **Complexity Discussion**: Time/space tradeoffs with real-world context
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive testing mindset

**Real Engineering Mindset**: Code written as if it's going to production - proper naming, error handling, and documentation.

## Hiring Value Proposition

This repository demonstrates:
- **Technical Depth**: Understanding of computer science fundamentals
- **Code Craftsmanship**: Attention to clean, maintainable code
- **Learning Ability**: Consistent progress and self-improvement
- **Communication Skills**: Ability to explain complex concepts clearly
- **Professional Mindset**: Approaching problems like a software engineer, not just a student
